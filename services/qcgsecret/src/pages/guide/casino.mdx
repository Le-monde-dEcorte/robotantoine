<Alert type="warning" title="Warning">
	For this step, you will need to be focused, in fact it involve a very strict timing to succeed, and you must one-shot

**Role: Murderer & Bystander:** <br />
Two red buttons are found under the Security Office desk. Both members of this team will have to be prepared to push the buttons at the same time, when the sheriff calls it. In case of success, the murderer must stab the poster in the security room, otherwise he must remain motionless and try again.

**Role: Sheriff:** <br />
A Power box is located at the Bedroom, near the scaffolding area.

Once you have found it, you will need to shoot it for the step to begin. A spark will exit the power box and start to move.
You will need to count how many time it disappear, when the Fourth-Fifth Sparks blow you will need to call your teammate
to push the buttons to briefly disable the blockers.

If you hear a buzzing sound that means your teammates have succeeded. When the spark is at the last emplacement from the
breaker and disappear (7 Sparks), you must shoot the breaker to make the sparks continue to follow the cable. Repeat this
process once more, but be aware there are not as many sparks before reaching the next circuit breaker. If succeed, quickly
go down near the fate machine because there are two more breakers. After these two blockers, the spark will start it's last
thrust and move towards another electrical box. You will do the same as the blocker but the timing is not the same, so be
aware of that before shooting the box!

<br />A completion cue will play, but it's not the end, because you will need to go as quickly as possible in the
security office to shoot the blue part of the keypad, to get a key card that can be used in the keycard reader at the
main door.

To start this step, you must at first shoot the vent in the Slot area thus making a telephone will fall from it. One of the players has to grab it and get close to the red locker and push it onto the locker. This will trigger a hack sequence: The phone attempts to connect to the computer.

The other player should be in the control room at the same time. All monitors will start to turn red. The player will have to say go when the title will begin to shift.

On the telephone, there will be a little red square that is synchronized with the computer. You must decide which tile is good one by synchronizing the flashing phone and computer movement.

Pay attention not to try to read the without the "Go", as it has a starting time. The sequence has a duration of about 1 seconds, you must be focused to decode it correctly.

<Alert type="info" title="Tips">
	Don't let the player with the phone alone, ask him a screen share.
