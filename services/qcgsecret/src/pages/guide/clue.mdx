</Step>

<Header title="Neptunia Frames">2-3 players</Header>
<Step>

For this step, you will need to obtain the 12 Neptunia frames, located at these locations:

Once you have them all, bring the frames to the main doors. A clock signal will be emitted, and an orb will appear and enter the weapon's locked container in the middle.

</Step>
<Header title="Sacrificial Ritual">3 players - Only Bystander</Header>
<Step>
You will need to get a hidden cross from the television room, located on the locked containers and put it in the puddle that does not have a cross in the rope room. Next, all three must use the rope. Each person will make all the cross burn. Once completed, a completion cue will be played and the locked containers will be unlocked and you can find an ammo box inside..
</Step>
<Header title="Wild West">4 Sherrifs</Header>
<Step>
Upon completion of each previous step, you will need to get 4 sheriffs ready for each gong. They'll need to shoot at the same time their gong. One of them will have to start a countdown to get everybody synced up. If everyone shoots at the same time, all gongs will emit a powerful sound and break the glass containers at the entrance. Otherwise, it means they fail, so retry.
</Step>
<Header title="Breaking out">1 player</Header>
<Step>
A player will have to grab the Gun in the now free by interacting with it,
wuth your action key. Once done, go to the TV room to collide it with the ammo box. And hurry to the main gate to throw
the weapon on it. The door will shatter and a metal door will close on a weird portal to keep you from leaving.
